decaf-ruby
==========

ruby scripts for decaf


download decaf ruby browser from http://trydecaf.org


open the app


run the scripts line by line from the usage.rb file



why I wrote it
===============

you can run your ruby scripts from github directly, without hosting it in some other place

I never really liked javascript, manipulating dom in my favourite language ruby is lot more fun

hope other people can try it as well
